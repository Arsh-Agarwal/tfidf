In each round, the ith player from the front of the row competes against the ith player from the end of the row, and the winner advances to the next round.

The 1 is currently located at position 0, so we need to reverse the subarray [0, 2] for it to leave that position, but reversing that subarray makes position 2 have a 1, which shouldn't happen. So, we can't move the 1 from position 0, making the result for all the other positions -1. \n",

We then remove the closest 'a' to the left of index 1, which is at index 0, and the closest 'a' to the right of index 1, which is at index 2. After this operation, the string becomes \"abc\".

      "Given two version numbers, version1 and version2, compare them.\n",

This means that revisions 1 and 001 are considered equal. If a version number does not specify a revision at an index, then treat the revision as 0. For example, version 1.0 is less than version 1.1 because their revision 0s are the same, but their revision 1s are 0 and 1 respectively, and 0 < 1.\n",

      "Sometimes you have a long running task, and you may wish to cancel it before it completes. To help with this goal, write a function cancellable that accepts a generator object and returns an array of two values: a cancel function and a promise.\n",
      "You may assume the generator function will only yield promises. It is your function's responsibility to pass the values resolved by the promise back to the generator. If the promise rejects, your function should throw that error back to the generator.\n",
      "If the cancel callback is called before the generator is done, your function should throw an error back to the generator. That error should be the string \"Cancelled\" (Not an Error object). If the error was caught, the returned promise should resolve with the next value that was yielded or returned. Otherwise, the promise should reject with the thrown error. No more code should be executed.\n",
      "When the generator is done, the promise your function returned should resolve the value the generator returned. If, however, the generator throws an error, the returned promise should reject with the error.\n",

      "The safe has a peculiar way of checking the password. When you enter in a sequence, it checks the most recent n digits that were entered each time you type a digit.\n",

      "Given a C++ program, remove comments from it. The program source is an array of strings source where source[i] is the ith line of the source code. This represents the result of splitting the original source code string by the newline character '\\n'.\n",
      "In C++, there are two types of comments, line comments, and block comments.\n",
      "The string \"//\" denotes a line comment, which represents that it and the rest of the characters to the right of it in the same line should be ignored.\n",
      "The string \"/*\" denotes a block comment, which represents that all characters until the next (non-overlapping) occurrence of \"*/\" should be ignored. (Here, occurrences happen in reading order: line by line from left to right.) To be clear, the string \"/*/\" does not yet end the block comment, as the ending would be overlapping the beginning.\n",
      "The first effective comment takes precedence over others.\n",
      "For example, if the string \"//\" occurs in a block comment, it is ignored.\n",
      "Similarly, if the string \"/*\" occurs in a line or block comment, it is also ignored.\n",
      "If a certain line of code is empty after removing comments, you must not output that line: each string in the answer list will be non-empty.\n",
      "There will be no control characters, single quote, or double quote characters.\n",
      "For example, source = \"string s = \"/* Not a comment. */\";\" will not be a test case.\n",
      "Also, nothing else such as defines or macros will interfere with the comments.\n",
      "It is guaranteed that every open block comment will eventually be closed, so \"/*\" outside of a line or block comment always starts a new comment.\n",
      "Finally, implicit newline characters can be deleted by block comments. Please see the examples below for details.\n",

      "A debounced function is a function whose execution is delayed by t milliseconds and whose execution is cancelled if it is called again within that window of time. The debounced function should also receive the passed parameters.\n",
      "For example, let's say t = 50ms, and the function was called at 30ms, 60ms, and 100ms. The first 2 function calls would be cancelled, and the 3rd function call would be executed at 150ms. If instead t = 35ms, The 1st call would be cancelled, the 2nd would be executed at 95ms, and the 3rd would be executed at 135ms.\n",
